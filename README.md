# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

- the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
- the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
- the 5 is (2+3),
- and so on!

The Fibonacci Sequence can be written as a "Rule".

<p style="color:steelblue"><b>The Rule is x<sub>n</sub> = x<sub>n−1</sub> + x<sub>n−2</sub></b><p>

where:

- x<sub>n</sub> is term number "n"
- x<sub>n−1</sub> is the previous term (n−1)
- x<sub>n−2</sub> is the term before that (n−2)
